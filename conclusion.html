      <h2>Wrapping It Up: Expanding Country Music and Cowboy Culture.</h2>
      <p><br>Country music and cowboy culture became deeply intertwined as the cowboy rose to icon status in the early 1900s. But over time, entertainment industry execs crafted and sold a version of both that aligned with conservative, White, hyper-masculine ideals. The problem? That narrative leaves out a whole lot of truth.</p>
      <p><br>The reality is that life on the Western frontier It was built on resilience, cooperation, and diversity—across race, gender, and identity. The romanticized, commercial version of the cowboy and country music erases much of that history.</p>
      <p><br>Thankfully, trailblazers like Beyoncé, Ja’Dayia Kursh, and Courtenay DeHoff are pushing those boundaries, reminding the world that there’s room in this culture for everyone. If the industry is going to grow and truly reflect the richness of its roots, it needs more changemakers—people willing to show up, speak out, and celebrate diversity in all its forms.

    <p><br>Because cowboy culture? It belongs to all of us.</p>
