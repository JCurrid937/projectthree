# projectthree
## Overview
This project is a responsive web app for dissecting social fault lines in country music and cowboy culture and its diverse history. I chose to use HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript for lightweight performance and ease of responsiveness.
## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS/JS** – Simple structure with custom styling control.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first framework for fast, responsive design.
- **GitHub Pages** – Free hosting solution for static sites.
## Design Decisions
- Opted for a mobile-first responsive grid using Flexbox for easier alignment of text and images.
- Chose to feature text prominently on the left and images on the right for a traditional reading flow.
