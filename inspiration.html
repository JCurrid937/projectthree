      <h2>Case Study Origin</h2>
      </p>I developed this case study while enrolled in the Texas Christian University (TCU) Master of Liberal Arts course, "Special Problems — Cultural Conflicts Societal Fault Lines," taught by Dr. Jean Marie Brown during the summer 2024 semester. Dr. Brown asked our class to craft a case study topic around one of our class readings. I developed my topic around an article relating the backlash Beyonce faced for the release of her 2024 album, "Act II: Cowboy Carter." <a href="https://time.com/6965367/cowboy-carter-black-country-history/">Read the article here.</a></p>
      </p><br>When Beyoncé dropped her 2024 album Act II: Cowboy Carter, she made history as the first Black woman to top the Billboard Country Albums Chart. But let’s be real—it wasn’t all applause. The release stirred up plenty of controversy and criticism, especially from within the country music world.</p>
      <p><br>Even though the album is a powerful tribute to her Texas roots—complete with Western sounds, themes, and imagery—some folks still insisted it wasn’t “cowboy enough.” That kind of gatekeeping isn’t new for Beyoncé. Back in 2016, she was publicly snubbed by country stars like Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt after performing at the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards.</p>
    <p><br>Beyoncé’s journey through the country genre shines a light on a much bigger issue: who gets to be part of country music and cowboy culture—and who gets shut out.</p>
