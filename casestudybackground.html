      <h2> Who Gets to Belong?</h2>
      <p> <br>This case study explores how sexism, racism, and a lack of diversity have shaped—and limited—who is welcomed in country music and cowboy culture. It dives deep into the gatekeeping that defines who is seen as “authentic” in these spaces and challenges the narrow stereotypes often associated with them.</p>
     <p><br>We shine a spotlight on the rich, often overlooked contributions of Black individuals to both country music and the cowboy way of life—past and present. Through these stories and facts, we reveal a powerful truth: country music and cowboy culture were never built by just one type of person. Instead, they thrive because of a diverse mix of voices, histories, and identities.</p>
